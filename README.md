### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Neilâ€™s research and development focuses on problems in software design and requirements. Some example problems are how to help people build large software systems, supporting researchers in non software fields in data science and building software, such as astronomy, geography, and oceanography. An ongoing research challenge is understanding how machine learning and AI will influence the design of future software systems and tools.
